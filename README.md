# timestamp-remover
- Zoom offers audio transcriptions for cloud recordings, which are divided into sections, each with a timestamp that shows how far into the recording that portion of the text was recorded.
- This program will remove the timestamps from the automated transcripts. Any blank lines will also be removed (unless a small change is made to the program, which is clearly indicated in the code).
